# Tests

Fast unit and integration tests for Simple Spam Shield. They run **without a
WordPress install or a database** — `bootstrap.php` stubs the handful of WP
functions the code touches and reuses the plugin's own autoloader.

## Running

```bash
composer test            # all tests
vendor/bin/phpunit --filter TokenTest   # a single test class
```

CI runs the same suite on PHP 8.1, 8.2, and 8.3 (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`).

## Layout

| File | Covers |
| --- | --- |
| `TokenTest` | HMAC token signing round-trip and rejection of tampered/forged/empty tokens |
| `RequestTest` | visitor-IP resolution and the trusted-proxy rule |
| `HoneypotTest`, `TimeGateTest`, `NonceTest`, `LinkLimitTest`, `KeywordBlockTest`, `DuplicateTest`, `BehavioralTest` | one file per guard — blocking and passing paths |
| `DatabaseManagerTest` | the prepared filter-clause builder (`build_filter`) |
| `CommentsIntegrationTest` | a comment driven through the real `Guard_Runner` pipeline and routed to the spam queue |

## How the stubs work

`bootstrap.php` keeps in-memory stores that tests read and write directly:

- `$GLOBALS['simple_spam_shield_test_options']` — backs `get_option()` / `update_option()`.
- `$GLOBALS['simple_spam_shield_test_transients']` — backs the transient functions.
- `$GLOBALS['simple_spam_shield_test_caps']` — backs `current_user_can()`.

`wp_die()` is stubbed to **throw** (so the hard-block path can be asserted),
and `WP_Error` is a minimal stand-in. Set state in `setUp()`, e.g.:

```php
protected function setUp(): void {
    $GLOBALS['simple_spam_shield_test_options'] = [
        'simple_spam_shield_token_secret' => str_repeat( 'k', 64 ),
    ];
}
```

## Adding a test for a new guard

Guards are plain objects — construct one with its slug and config array, set
any options it reads, then assert the return value:

```php
$guard  = new My_Guard( 'my_guard', [ 'threshold' => 5 ] );
$result = $guard->check( [ 'content' => '…' ], 'comment' );

$this->assertTrue( $result );                       // passed
$this->assertInstanceOf( WP_Error::class, $result ); // blocked
```

Cover the blocking path, the passing path, and — if the guard depends on a
JS-injected field — the `'jetpack_form'` context, where it should skip
rather than hard-fail.

If the tested class calls a WP function not yet stubbed, add a guarded
`if ( ! function_exists( … ) )` stub to `bootstrap.php`.

This directory is excluded from the distributed plugin (see `.distignore`).
